# Factory Function and Constructor Function

In JavaScript, we have can define objects with literal value.
Like code below.

```js
const student = {
  name: 'john',
  age: 24,
  walk() {
    console.log('john is walking')
  }
}
```

However, if we need to define many objects with the same structure, this approach can be tedious.
There are two comman ways to create object with specific params.
+ Factory function
+ Construct function

Here's a simple example

```js
// Factory function
// naming convention createXxxx()
function createStudent(name, age, walking) {
  return {
    name,
    age,
    walking
  } 
}

// Constructor function
// naming convention Xxxx()
function Student(name, age, walking) {
  this.name = age;
  this.age = age;
  this.walking = walking;
}

const stu1 = createStudent('mike', 14, () => console.log('mike is walking'));

// using `new` keyword to call constructor function 
const stu2 = new Student('jason', 35, () => console.log('jason is walking'));

console.log(`stu1: ${stu1}`);
console.log(`stu2: ${stu2}`);
```

When you run this code, you can see both approaches works fine.

# Choosing between Factory and Constructor Function

You can choose either one depends on your needs:
+ Factory function is very straightfoward, and is easy to work with object composition.
+ Constructor function is a little bit complex to use. When you use **new Student()** the following things happens.
1. a new empty object is created
2. the object is binded with **this** pointer
3. the Student function is called 
4. the object is assigned to the *stu* variable
To fully understand Constructor function, it's very necessary to understand the concept of **this**.
The contructor function is also widely used in ES6 class syntax.

# Recap
Both factory and constructor functions are useful ways to create objects. I recommend learning both, as they provide flexibility in how you design object creation in your code.
