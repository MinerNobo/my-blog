In JavaScript, we have can define objects with literal value.
Like code below.

```js
const student = {
  name: 'john',
  age: 24,
  walk() {
    console.log('john is walking')
  }
}
```

But, if we need to define many student in the same structure, this approach seems to be tedious.
There are two ways to create object with specific params.
+ Factory function
+ Construct function

Here are a simple example

```js
// Factory function
// naming convention createXxxx()
function createStudent(name, age, walking) {
  return {
    name,
    age,
    walking
  } 
}

// Constructor function
// naming convention Xxxx()
function Student(name, age, walking) {
  this.name = age;
  this.age = age;
  this.walking = walking;
}

const stu1 = createStudent('mike', 14, () => console.log('mike is walking'));

// using `new` keyword to call constructor function 
const stu2 = new Student('jason', 35, () => console.log('jason is walking'));

console.log(`stu1: ${stu1}`);
console.log(`stu2: ${stu2}`);
```

Run this code, you can see these two approaches works fine.

Actually, you can choose either one.
+ Factory function is very straightfoward, and is easy to use composition.
+ Constructor function is a little bit complex to use.When using constructor function, you should use **new** keyword to create and bind **this** pointer to the constructor function, and the constructor function add property to this.
Finally, it returns **this** object.It is useful when you use ES6 class syntax and OOP, also very important.

To recap, both Factory and Construct are useful ways create objects.I highly recommend you to command them.
