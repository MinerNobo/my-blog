title: Debounce and Throttle
description:In this post, we will explore two important techniques in JavaScript: debounce and throttle. These are useful for optimizing the performance of functions that are triggered frequently, such as scroll, resize, or button click events. We will provide simple examples of both and explain when to use them.

## 1. Debounce
Debounce is useful when a function is called frequently, potentially slowing down your app. With debounce, the function is only executed after a specified amount of time has passed since the last time it was invoked.

Here's an example of how debounce works.

Below is the HTML code for a button:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Debounce Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <button id="button">Click me</button>
    </div>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
And here’s the JavaScript:
```js
function initApp() {
  const button = document.querySelector('#button');
  button.addEventListener('click', debounce(onClick, 2000));
}

function onClick() {
  console.log('clicked');
}

function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let id;
  return (...args) => {
    if (id) clearTimeout(id);
    id = setTimeout(() => {
      fn(...args);
    }, delay);
  };
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp);
```
### Explanation:
In this example, if you click the button multiple times, only the last click within the delay period (500ms) will trigger the onClick function.

Let’s break down the debounce function:

It initializes an id variable and returns an anonymous function.
Every time the anonymous function is called, it clears the previous timeout (if one exists) and sets a new timeout.
This ensures that the function fn is only executed once after the delay, no matter how many times it is called during that period.
If you pass debounce(onClick, 2000) and click the button multiple times within 2 seconds, only the last call will execute after the delay.

## 2. Throttle
Throttle is used when you want to ensure that a function is called at most once during a specified time interval. Unlike debounce, which waits for inactivity, throttle ensures that the function is executed at regular intervals, no matter how many times the event is triggered.

Here’s an example:

```js
function initApp() {
  const button = document.querySelector('#button');
  button.addEventListener('click', throttle(onClick, 2000));
}

function onClick() {
  console.log('clicked');
}

function throttle(fn, delay) {
  let lastTime = 0;
  return (...args) => {
    let now = new Date().getTime();
    if (now - lastTime < delay) return;
    lastTime = now;
    fn(...args);
  };
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp);
```
### Explanation:
In the throttle example, clicking the button multiple times within 2 seconds will only trigger the onClick function once.

Here’s how the throttle function works:

It stores the last time the function was executed.
When the event occurs, it checks if the time since the last function call is less than the specified delay (in this case, 2000ms). If it is, the function is not called. Otherwise, it updates the lastTime and executes the function.

## When to Use Debounce and Throttle
Debounce is ideal for situations where you want to wait until a user stops triggering an event, such as:
+ Search input fields (triggering a search when the user stops typing)
+ Resizing a window (only executing the resize handler when the user finishes resizing)

Throttle is useful when you want to control the rate at which a function is triggered, for example:
+ Scroll events (executing a function every X milliseconds during a scroll)
+ Button clicks that trigger a costly operation like API requests (limiting how often the request is sent)

## Recap:
Debounce ensures the function is only called after a delay from the last event.
Throttle ensures the function is called at most once per delay interval.
